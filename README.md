# My reset

This started as Eric Meyer's CSS reset, I've kept it up to date and added the default styling that I need for each project I'm working on. 

## Customization
With each project I'll do a few things like remove the part particular to Angular if I'm not working on an Angular project. I'll change the width of .wrapper, and change the headline font-sizes, colors, and font-families. 

## Sass
The variables and mixins files are there for reference but technically not part of my reset. Neither file isn being imported into the reset, simply here for reference. 

A quick note on the mixins file. I tend to use less mixins for vendor prefixes these days and instead use autoprefixer as there's no extra thinking involved.
